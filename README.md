Literature chatbot
LitBot is a machine learning-powered virtual assistant designed to streamline information retrieval and question-answering from extensive PDF documents. Built on advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, LitBot leverages document embedding and deep learning models to locate and extract relevant information efficiently. It incorporates a two-step process: first, by using sentence embeddings with FAISS indexing, LitBot identifies the most relevant sections of the document; then, a pre-trained question-answering model generates context-specific responses. Through an interactive GUI, users can query LitBot on a wide range of topics covered in the document, making it ideal for summarizing, studying, and understanding dense technical material. This intelligent assistant aims to enhance accessibility to information in large documents by delivering concise, accurate answers and simplifying content navigation.
